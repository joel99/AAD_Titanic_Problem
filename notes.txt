Feature Engineering:
  Columns we select:
  Survival (for converting to label)
  Sex - transform into 0/1
  Age
  Sibsp
  Parch

TODO List:
  Create function that iterates over hyperparams to find best classifier, scoring based on cross_val mean with false positives and false negative 
  Feature engineer
  Create function that plugs in trained classifiers, generate score with false positives and false negatives, create graph with pareto front
  

  final driver:
    feature engineer
      - decided to keep:
        - survived, pclass, sex, age, sibsp, parch, ticket, fare, (embarked)
  
    method call each hyperparam optimizer per classifier using cross_val_score
      - returns untrained model with suggested hyperparams
    we have a list of final params, train on entire train set

    functions that plug in trained classifier, create graphs
